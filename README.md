## Automated daily trading system for selected US companies

Our project focuses on predicting stock price movements for five different U.S. companies using machine learning techniques. By leveraging historical share prices, we developed a predictive model to assist brokers and/or any individual in making informed financial decisions. The end-to-end solution integrates data extraction, transformation, and predictive modelling into an interactive web application. Besides offering a prediction of the next days' stock movement (price will increase OR price will decrease/remain the same), the application collects further useful information about the companies. The 5 companies are:
- Apple 
- Microsoft
- Bruker
- Tesla
- Abbott

### Instructions on the use of this trading system

**Disclaimer:**
This daily trading system will help you understand stock price movements and provide you with further company related information in a convenient way. However, please note, that this project utilizes a basic logistic regression model to predict stock price movements. While the model is based on historical data, predicting stock movements is inherently complex and uncertain due to the dynamic nature of financial markets.

This tool is intended for educational and exploratory purposes only and should not be relied upon for real-world trading or investment decisions. Market conditions, external factors, and economic events can significantly impact stock prices in ways that are beyond the scope of this model.

We encourage users to consider this limitation when using the tool and to complement it with further research, expert analysis, and risk management strategies.

ðŸ“Œ Use at your own discretion. We assume no responsibility for financial decisions based on these predictions.
